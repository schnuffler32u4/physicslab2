## Abstract

This report investigates how circuit resistance and mutual inductance of two separated coils influence wireless
power transmission (WPT) utilizing two inductively coupled resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits. An
experiment was set up to explore how, through the phenomenon of resonance frequencies of alternating current
(AC), power transmission between inductively-coupled RLC circuits can be optimized with the above-mentioned
independent variables. The experiment has found that mutual inductance, determined through inductor separation,
can be adjusted to a critical range of values at 100-105mm, where the peak circuit voltages overlap, thereby
providing maximal power transmission, after which a rapid drop-off occurs, with chi-squared around 57.49 for
46 degrees of freedom, and R-squared higher than 0.99 for the fitted relationship. The experiment has also
confirmed the importance of careful tuning of AC frequency, where only resonance frequencies provide stable
peak voltages. The report, in addition, presents a theoretical model to contrast with the results. Both the model
and the experiment show the resistance to be an important parameter in the transmitted voltage. It was found
that the model was most successful in producing the voltage frequencies in the case of 50mm and 350mm coil
separations when applied as a best-fit. On the other hand, further investigation needs to be conducted as the
model was not predictive with respect to other measurements. It is recommended that a suitable theoretical
model be derived before any commercial implementation of coupled RLC circuits in WPT.
