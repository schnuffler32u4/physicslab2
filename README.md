Basically what the title sounds like, trying to get an optimized fit and then use it to predict how values change.

In order to create

We get a local maximum with p0 = [0.8, 1, 5.48, 3.69047095e+13, 1e20]

We can write the differential equation in the form 
![img](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1654167900/render.png) which we can get the particular solution to as the solution to the attached homogenous equation goes to zero as time goes to infinity.
